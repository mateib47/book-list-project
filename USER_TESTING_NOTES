- forgot to activate the account and after that he didn't know what to do
- menu bar on mobile too narrow and the text is cut
- privacy concerns regarding database
- wanted to see thumbnail and the author in the main list
- title too big "X's Book List" (on mobile)
- maybe replace the delete button with something smaller
and have a popup to confirm when it is deleted
- make the option finished in add book default
- idea - change book list ui - have something with circles
