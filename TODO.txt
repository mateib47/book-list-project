General TODO:
-add more options to the form(add the author, rate the book, save your favourite quote, etc)
-the book should have the attribute progress instead of finished (finished/to read/in progress)
-deal with long words that do not wrap
-make a menu on the left

Author Book List TODO
-right now, author-booklist is a dummy implementation;
I have to find a way to display the books in a smarter way()send a json file with book objects
-add the authors, image of the book cover and a link to purchase it


Ideas

Have a large grid where the most read authors are shown in different sized boxes(maybe the same with genres)
Input box for the book in progress where you can input how many pages did you read where you can see the %,
Have a calendar that tracks your progress(similar to git commit)


Do not forget

update the Legend
adjust to mobile devices
