General TODO:
-the book should have the attribute progress instead of finished (finished/to read/in progress)
-deal with long words that do not wrap
-auto complete function
-make a footer
improve usability
fix change your name- remove the paragraph with instructions
-share your book list
add book-add option for no author
something weird happened in .finished css; had to add !important but idk why

Author Book List TODO
-right now, author-booklist is a dummy implementation;
I have to find a way to display the books in a smarter way()send a json file with book objects
-add the authors, image of the book cover and a link to purchase it

Ideas

Have a large grid where the most read authors are shown in different sized boxes(maybe the same with genres)
Input box for the book in progress where you can input how many pages did you read where you can see the %,
Have a calendar that tracks your progress(similar to git commit)


Do not forget

update the Legend
adjust to mobile devices
fix the id's and css

progress

reload data from memory
dropdown with the books in the list so you can select from which book you reading
deal with leap years
when user adds some pages in a day it should not rewrite the previous record

Statistics

make graphs
