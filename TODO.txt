General TODO:
-make a footer
-share your book list - something like author booklist type page
- improve author book list
- add shields to the readme page
- add installation to readme
- make a config file



Ideas

Have a large grid where the most read authors are shown in different sized boxes(maybe the same with genres)

Do not forget

update the Legend
adjust to mobile devices
fix the id's and css

Progress

when you add progress for a future book it should go to in-progress state automatically
deal with leap years
fix the bug with the divider being sometimes bigger

Statistics

maybe remake the stats js; it needs more abstraction;
top books

Done / Resolved

-the dropdown should have an onther field where you can write it
above dropdown it should be two radio buttons and after selecting one the dropdown should update
make backend where you can make an account
-right now, author-booklist is a dummy implementation;
I have to find a way to display the books in a smarter way()send a json file with book objects
-add the authors, image of the book cover and a link to purchase it
