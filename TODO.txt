General TODO:
-auto complete function
-make a footer
improve usability
-share your book list
-the dropdown should have an onther field where you can write it
above dropdown it should be two radio buttons and after selecting one the dropdown should update


Author Book List TODO
-right now, author-booklist is a dummy implementation;
I have to find a way to display the books in a smarter way()send a json file with book objects
-add the authors, image of the book cover and a link to purchase it

Ideas

Have a large grid where the most read authors are shown in different sized boxes(maybe the same with genres)
Input box for the book in progress where you can input how many pages did you read where you can see the %,
Have a calendar that tracks your progress(similar to git commit)


Do not forget

update the Legend
adjust to mobile devices
fix the id's and css

progress
when you add progress for a future book it should go to in-progress state automatically
deal with leap years
fix the bug with the divider being sometimes bigger

Statistics

remake the stats js; it needs more abstraction;
top books
most read authors
fix design of piechart and legend
