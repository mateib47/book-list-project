### Motivation
I first started this project because I was tired of storing all the books 
I wanted to read in a notepad on my phone. Of course, 
there are already existing applications like Goodreads, but I felt like it's 
confusing, at times to the point of being almost unusable.

### Evolution

In the beginning, this was a simple web page that let you save your favourite
book titles. At the time I started this project I had almost no experience
in web development. Over the course of several months, both the project and my knowledge evolved considerably.

### Libraries

I chose to use **no frontend libraries** for the development of this project. 
Although using them is great from a time saving perspective, I felt like it would have starved
me from getting into the basics of this field. I only used Charts.js, Font Awesome and Google Books API. Also, I used Bootstrap and Thymeleaf for the login page.<br>
However, on the backend side I used Java and Springboot. I decided to 
use Springboot because I already implemented a vanilla Java web server 
during one of my university courses. 

## Roadmap

For now, I am doing user testing, and I am looking into ways to make the project better.
The overall  design is very simple, and I am planning to change it to be more appealing and friendly. I am constantly fixing bugs and adding new features.
